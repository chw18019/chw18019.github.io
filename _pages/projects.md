    text: "This project aims to predict the third-party sellers' resources with Python. After spending most of the time on data cleaning and pre-processing, machine learning algorithms were applied to predict the outcomes. As a result, the model has 88% accuracy. Besides, several business insights are generated based on feature importance and partial dependence plots(PDP)."
