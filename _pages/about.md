&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I help companies process data into actionable business solutions. My diverse blend of technical skills, including **data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and database management**, make me a uniquely valuable potential addition to your analysis team. My mother tongue is Python, and I am learning Java as my second language. Having a keen eye for details and a passion for data, I am eager and capable of turning raw data into business solutions. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have experience working with `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-Learn`, `Tensorflow`, and many other popular data analysis libraries. When I was pursuing my Master's degree, I worked as a graduate analyst consultant for several companies. For Forkaia, I conducted data collection, data cleaning, and segment analysis, and I used `SQLAlchemy` to build a small dataset for users to perform queries with Python language. For Potoo Innovations, I built a classification model to predict third-party retailersâ€™ resources with an accuracy rate as high as 88%. Besides a strong performance predictive model, I also identified important factors on each resource. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the meanwhile, I enjoyed working on the school projects and side projects. They are mainly machine learning projects but not limit to. For examples, I used web scraping API `Scrapy` and twitter API `Tweepy` to generate data from  Websites. For more details, you can navigate to the [Project page](https://chw18019.github.io/projects). I believe with my skills and experience, I will make positive contributions to your team.
