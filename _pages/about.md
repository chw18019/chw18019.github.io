-- ✳︎ Abilities and Experience
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I help companies process data into actionable business solutions. My diverse blend of technical skills, including **data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and database management**, make me a uniquely valuable potential addition to your analysis team. My mother tongue is Python, and I am learning Java as my second language. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When pursing my Master's degree, I worked as a graduate analyst consultant for several companies. For Forkaia, I conducted data collection, data cleaning, and segment analysis, and I used SQLAlchemy to build a small dataset for users to perform queries with Python language. For Potoo Innovations, I built a classification model to predict third-party retailers’ resources with an accuracy rate as high as 88%. Besides a predictive model with strong performance, I also identified important factors on each resource. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My school projects and side projects are mainly machine learning projects but not limit to. For examples, I used web scraping API **Scrapy** and twitter API **Tweepy** to generate data from  Websites. For more details, you can navigate to the [Project page](https://chw18019.github.io/projects). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a keen eye for details and a passion for data, I am eager and capable of turning raw data into business solutions. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:chi-hua.wu@uconn.edu?subject=[GithubPages]) if you think I might be a good fit to your company. 

-- ✳︎ A little bit more about me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm born and raised in Taiwan by the supportive parents for any decision I made. I'm good at math and biology, at least in junior high school. It led me to study Statistics and Business Analytics, and my apartment always filled with plants. 

Love cooking, jogging, and traveling.
